# Blinded 
Play the casual game [Tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) without a gameboard to improve your short-term memory.
Sure, one could play it without an app - But now, you can stop arguing with your friends about who did a mistake.
IMHO, this is superior to methods like *Dual N-Back* for improving your short-term memory - because it's fun! I have done this, without an app, for the last few months and I can already see an improvement in my memory.
