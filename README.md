Play casual games like [Tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe), [Connect Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four) or even [chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess) without a gameboard to improve your short-term memory.
Sure, one could play [Tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) without an app - But now, you can stop arguing with your friends about who did a mistake. Especially when it comes to more difficult games like chess a third party which validates every turn is really usefull.
IMHO, this is superior to methods like *Dual N-Back* for improving your short-term memory - because it's fun! I have done this, without an app, for the last few months and I can already see an improvement in my memory.

There is a plan on implementing an multiplayer, various difficulties, customizations and more games. But for now, I'd suggest we concentrate on [Tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe), [Connect Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four) and [chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess)
